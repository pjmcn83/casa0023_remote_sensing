## Summary

Write a succinct summary of what has been learnt this week but not just rehashing what was taught in the lectures.

## Application

For a specific topic from this week identify two readings and summarise them and then provide a comparison of the two. Raise any questions related to the topic.

### Reading 1

Talk about key findings from this reading

### Reading 2

Then talk about key findings from this reading

### Comparison

Provide a comparison between the two readings, but ensure that individual thought is included. So do I agree with what is discussed, could further clarification or research benefit the article.

## Reflection

Discuss how the skills, tools, etc. could be put into practice and how this could or could not be useful in future.
