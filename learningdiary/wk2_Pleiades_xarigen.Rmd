# Use Cases

- Crisis Management
- Maritime Monitoring
- Agriculture
- Urban Planning
- Forestry
- Environmental Monitoring

There are many use cases for Pléiades Neo as shown above. I could just use sample images from the AirBus or ESA's website however in my work at London Borough of Camden we were lucky enough to take part in an EO Pilot scheme for the Public Sector which included access the Pleiades Neo images. 

Therefore I can instead talk specifically about the Camden use case which looked at vegetation health.

# Vegetation Health 1

```

# Vegetation Health 2

Camden then produced a Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to understand vegetation health of the Borough.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('C:/UCL/CASA0023 RS/casa0023_remote_sensing/learningdiary/images/ndvi2022.png')
```

.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}

```

# Limitations 

At the time of the pilot Camden lacked the time, resource, technology and expertise to analyse the EO data in a timely manner.  As such this was as far as the pilot got so further temporal data could not accessed for further comparison.

Other issues we faced included accessing images for the right time of year. The images shown were from Autumn 2022 and 2023, therefore not the optimal time to accurately represent vegetation health.  Ideally images from Spring/early Summer would be used however the presence of excessive cloud cover in these images prevented their use.

# The future
### Pléiades Neo Next
.pull-left[
In April 2024 AirBus annouced the Pléiades Neo Next programme.

Few details are currently available but it Will provide native 20cm resolution imagery.

To launch in next few years and continue till at least 2040.

----
AirBus and others continue to push commercial EO capabilities with higher resolution capture.  This be seen by looking at the increase in high resolution sensors that are in orbit @belward2015.

# Reflection

Pléiades Neo is already a very powerful constellation and with Pléiades Neo Next to follow in the next few years with an increased resolution there is a clear trend to constant push to higher resolutions.

However, whilst increased spatial resolution is no doubt a good thing in certain cases we must be mindful of the use cases of such data.  For example for land use classification sub 20cm resolution is excessive. Whereas if we need to identify individual trees, vehicles then this increased resolution can bring greater accuracy to analysis and policy making.

There is work ongoing that aims to make higher resolution imagery more accessible, particularly in UK Local Government, so we could be seeing a shift to more EO based decision making in Local Government in the coming years. Although access to data is one thing and possessing and implementing the skills to effectively make use of this is another issue entirely.
